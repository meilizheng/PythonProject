# PythonProject
 use Pyton create a player class
 
What language did you choose?
I chose Pyton.

What IDE did you choose?
VS code

Did you have any difficulty getting it installed and running?
I watched some vedio on YOUTUBE, and install part was not difficult. 

Is it a higher or lower level language then C# and Java ( Which are both considered the same level )?
Python, C# and Jave are all high level language.

Is it a strongly or loosely typed language?
Python is a strong typed language

Is it a compiled or scripted language?
Python is both compiled as well as an interpreted language, which means when we run a python code, it is first compiled and then interpreted line by line. The compile part gets deleted as soon as the code gets executed in Python so that the programmer doesn't get onto unnecessary complexity. 

Why did you choose this language?
Popularity and Community Support: Python is widely used and has a large and active community of developers. This community support means that there are abundant resources, libraries, and frameworks available, making development more accessible.
Readability and Expressiveness: Python is known for its clear and readable syntax, which makes it easy for developers to write and maintain code. Its high-level nature allows for concise expression of ideas, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers.
Versatility: Python is a versatile language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It is used in various domains, including web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and more.
Extensive Libraries: Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for various purposes. In the context of machine learning and natural language processing, libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and NLTK are widely used.
Rapid Development: Python's simplicity and ease of use contribute to rapid prototyping and development. This is crucial in machine learning, where experimenting with models and iterating quickly is common.
Integration Capabilities: Python integrates well with other languages and technologies, making it suitable for a wide range of applications and scenarios.

What applications did you plan to build with it? ( Game, Mobile Application, Machine Learning AI, something with a Raspberry Pi )
I want to learn the Machine Learnign on Python.
